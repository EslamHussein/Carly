# Vehicle Management App

## Project Overview

This Android app enables users to manage their vehicles by allowing them to create, view, and delete
vehicles. The app dynamically displays features specific to the selected vehicle. Users can interact
with vehicle data such as brand, series, build year, and fuel type, and view specific vehicle
features like Diagnostics, Live Data, and Battery Check.

## Package structure

##### In this project, the package structure is divided into the following packages using feature per package:

- **di** - contains the dependency injection modules for the feature.
- **domain** - contains the business logic classes for the feature.
- **rp** - contains the repository classes for the feature.
- **vm** - contains the view model classes(view model - state - actions - sideffect) for the
  feature.
